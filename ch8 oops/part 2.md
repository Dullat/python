Sure! I'll break down your code and provide an analysis and notes based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python, covering topics like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding, operator overloading, encapsulation, getters and setters, and more.

### **OOP in Python: Concepts and Practices**

#### 1. **Creating Classes and Objects**

In Python, classes are blueprints for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes.

**Code Example:**

```python
class Person:
    name = "unknown"  # Class-level attribute
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Instance-level attribute
    
    def change_class_attr(self, name):
        Person.name = name  # Changing the class-level attribute

p1 = Person("duck")
print(p1.name, Person.name)

p2 = Person("quack")
print(p2.name, Person.name)

p2.change_class_attr("changed")
print(p2.name, Person.name)
```

- **`__init__(self, name)`**: This is the constructor method used to initialize the object's state. It's called when a new object is created.
- **Instance vs Class Attributes**: `self.name` is an instance attribute, while `Person.name` is a class attribute. Changing the class attribute (`Person.name`) affects all instances.

**Notes**:

- **Instance attributes** are specific to each object (e.g., `p1.name` and `p2.name`).
- **Class attributes** are shared by all objects of the class (e.g., `Person.name`).

#### 2. **Encapsulation (Private Attributes)**

Encapsulation refers to the concept of restricting access to certain details of an object and controlling how attributes are accessed and modified. Python uses a convention of prefixing an attribute with double underscores `__` to indicate that it is private.

**Code Example:**

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, user, password):
        self.user = user
        self.__password = password  # Private variable
    
    def print_pass(self):
        print(self.__password)

acc1 = Account("deck", "1234567890")
print(acc1.user)  # Public attribute
# print(acc1.password)  # Will generate error because __password is private
acc1.print_pass()
```

- **Private Attributes**: Attributes prefixed with `__` are private and can't be accessed directly outside the class. For example, `acc1.__password` would raise an error.
- Use **getter** or **setter** methods to interact with private attributes when necessary.

---

#### 3. **Inheritance**

Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class).

**Code Example:**

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, type):
        self.type = type
    
    @staticmethod
    def start(self):
        print("starting...")
    
    @staticmethod
    def stop(self):
        print("stopping...")

class Toyota(Car):
    def __init__(self, name, type):
        self.name = name
        super().__init__(type)  # Inherit the constructor of the parent class
        super().start()  # Calling the parent's static method

c1 = Toyota("fortuner", "petrol")
print(c1.type)
```

- **`super()`**: The `super()` function allows a child class to call methods from its parent class.
- In this example, the `Toyota` class inherits the methods and constructor of the `Car` class.

---

#### 4. **Polymorphism (Method Overloading / Operator Overloading)**

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class, often via method overriding or operator overloading.

**Code Example (Operator Overloading):**

```python
class Complex:
    def __init__(self, real, img):
        self.real = real
        self.img = img
    
    def __add__(self, num2):  # Overloading the + operator
        real = self.real + num2.real
        img = self.img + num2.img
        return Complex(real, img)

n1 = Complex(23, 56)
n2 = Complex(23, 56)
n3 = n1 + n2  # Using the overloaded + operator
print(n3.real)
```

- **Dunder Methods**: `__add__` is a special method (also called a dunder method) that allows you to define how the `+` operator behaves when used with instances of the `Complex` class.

---

#### 5. **Static Methods**

Static methods are functions that are part of a class but do not depend on instance variables. They can be called using the class name or instance.

**Code Example:**

```python
class Car:
    @staticmethod
    def start():
        print("starting...")
    
    @staticmethod
    def stop():
        print("stopping...")

Car.start()
```

- **Static methods** don't require `self` as a parameter because they don't operate on instance data.

---

#### 6. **Getter and Setter Methods**

In Python, getter and setter methods are often implemented using the `@property` decorator for getters and `@<property_name>.setter` for setters. These methods allow you to control access to an attribute.

**Code Example (Getters and Setters):**

```python
class Marks:
    def __init__(self, math, phy, chem):
        self.math = math
        self.phy = phy
        self.chem = chem
    
    @property
    def percentage(self):
        return str((self.math + self.phy + self.chem) / 3) + "%"
    
m1 = Marks(34, 57, 89)
print(m1.percentage)  # Getter

m1.math = 50  # Updating the value
print(m1.percentage)  # Updated percentage
```

- **Getter**: The `@property` decorator allows the method `percentage` to be accessed like an attribute (`m1.percentage`), rather than as a method (`m1.percentage()`).
- **Setter**: If you want to modify the value of an attribute with validation, you can create a setter method (not shown here but possible).

---

#### 7. **Operator Overloading (Comparison Operators)**

Python allows you to define how operators like `<`, `>`, `==`, etc., work with your custom objects.

**Code Example (Overloading `>` Operator):**

```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self, price):
        self.price = price
    
    def __gt__(self, obj):
        return self.price > obj.price

o1 = Order(237)
o2 = Order(45)

print(o1 > o2)  # Using overloaded > operator
```

- **`__gt__(self, obj)`**: This method overloads the `>` operator. It defines how objects of `Order` should behave when compared using the `>` operator.

---

### Summary of Key Concepts

1. **Classes and Objects**:
    
    - Classes define the structure and behavior of objects.
    - Objects are instances of classes.
2. **Encapsulation**:
    
    - Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object and only exposes a controlled interface (via methods).
3. **Inheritance**:
    
    - A class can inherit attributes and methods from another class, allowing reuse and extension of code.
4. **Polymorphism**:
    
    - Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as the same type, and methods can be overridden or operators overloaded.
5. **Static Methods**:
    
    - Static methods belong to the class and don't need access to instance data.
6. **Getter and Setter**:
    
    - Getters and setters allow controlled access to private attributes using the `@property` and `@<property>.setter` decorators.
7. **Operator Overloading**:
    
    - Custom behavior can be defined for standard operators (like `+`, `>`, etc.) using dunder methods.
