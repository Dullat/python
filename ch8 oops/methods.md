### Notes on **Methods** in Python

Methods in Python are functions that are defined inside a class. They are used to define behaviors or actions that can be performed by objects of that class. Methods are bound to the class and can operate on the attributes of objects (instances) and the class itself. Let's go through the different types of methods, including instance methods, class methods, and static methods, and cover the key concepts related to them.

---

### 1. **Instance Methods** (Regular Methods)

- **Definition**: Instance methods are the most common type of methods. These methods **operate on instances** of the class and have access to the instance’s attributes (through `self`).
    
- **Access**: They can access both **instance attributes** (`self.attribute`) and **class attributes** (through `cls` or the class name).
    
- **Syntax**: Instance methods are defined using the `def` keyword, and the first parameter is always `self`, which refers to the instance of the class.
    

#### Example:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}")

# Create an object
obj = MyClass("Alice", 30)

# Calling the instance method using the object
obj.display_info()  # Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30
```

#### Key Points:

- **Instance methods** can access instance variables (attributes) and manipulate object-specific data.
- They are **called on instances** of the class, and the object is automatically passed as the `self` argument.

### 2. **Class Methods**

- **Definition**: A **class method** is a method that is bound to the **class**, not the instance. It operates on **class-level data** and can modify the class's state. It cannot directly access instance-specific data.
    
- **Access**: Class methods have access to **class attributes** and can modify them, but they do not have access to instance attributes unless an instance is explicitly passed.
    
- **Syntax**: Class methods are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator, and the first parameter is always `cls`, which refers to the class.
    

#### Example:

```python
class MyClass:
    class_attr = 42

    @classmethod
    def update_class_attr(cls, value):
        cls.class_attr = value

# Calling the class method using the class name
MyClass.update_class_attr(100)

# Checking the class attribute
print(MyClass.class_attr)  # Output: 100
```

#### Key Points:

- **Class methods** can access and modify class-level data (class attributes), but they do not have access to instance-specific data.
- They are **called on the class** and are passed the class itself (`cls`).
- You can use **class methods** to modify class attributes or create alternative constructors for the class.

### 3. **Static Methods**

- **Definition**: A **static method** is a method that belongs to the class but does **not have access to instance-specific data (`self`)** or class-specific data (`cls`). It behaves like a regular function, but it is logically related to the class.
    
- **Access**: Static methods cannot access instance attributes or class attributes directly. They are not passed the `self` or `cls` parameters.
    
- **Syntax**: Static methods are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator. They behave like normal functions but are part of the class.
    

#### Example:

```python
class MathOperations:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y
    
    @staticmethod
    def subtract(x, y):
        return x - y

# Calling static methods using the class name
print(MathOperations.add(10, 5))  # Output: 15
print(MathOperations.subtract(10, 5))  # Output: 5
```

#### Key Points:

- **Static methods** do not take `self` or `cls` as parameters, and thus cannot access instance or class attributes.
- They are typically used for utility functions that don't depend on the object's state.
- Static methods can be called using both the **class** or an **instance**.

### 4. **Method Binding and Calling**

- **Method Binding**: When a method is called on an instance, Python binds the method to that instance. The instance (`self`) is passed automatically as the first argument to the method, allowing the method to access the instance's attributes and other methods.
    
- **Calling Methods**:
    
    - **Instance methods**: Called on an instance, and the `self` parameter is passed automatically.
    - **Class methods**: Called on the class itself or on an instance, and the `cls` parameter is passed automatically.
    - **Static methods**: Can be called on both the class and the instance, but they do not receive `self` or `cls`.

#### Example of Method Binding:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, {self.name}!")

# Create an instance
obj = MyClass("Alice")

# Calling the instance method, `self` is automatically passed
obj.greet()  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### 5. **Key Differences Between Instance, Class, and Static Methods**

|Feature|Instance Method|Class Method|Static Method|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Decorator**|None|`@classmethod`|`@staticmethod`|
|**First Parameter**|`self` (instance)|`cls` (class)|None|
|**Access to Instance**|Yes|No|No|
|**Access to Class**|Yes (via `self`)|Yes (via `cls`)|No (unless explicitly referenced)|
|**Calling Method**|Called on an instance|Can be called on the class or instance|Can be called on the class or instance|
|**Use Case**|Works with instance-specific data|Works with class-specific data|Independent of class or instance data|

### 6. **Summary of Methods in Python**:

- **Instance methods** are used to operate on an instance’s data and can access both instance and class attributes. These are the most commonly used methods in object-oriented programming in Python.
- **Class methods** are used when you need to operate on class-level data (class attributes) or create alternative constructors. These methods are bound to the class, not the instance.
- **Static methods** are used for operations that logically belong to the class but do not need access to the class or instance data. They behave like regular functions but are defined within the class.

### Important Considerations:

- **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: In case of multiple inheritance, Python uses the MRO to determine which method should be called from the hierarchy. The `super()` function can be used to call methods from the parent class.
- **Binding**: Methods in Python are **bound** to instances or classes. This means that when an instance method is called, the instance is automatically passed as the first argument (`self`).
- **Inheritance**: Methods can be overridden in subclasses to change their behavior.
