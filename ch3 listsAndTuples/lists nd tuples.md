### **1. Lists in Python**

- A **list** is a mutable, ordered collection of items.
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```python
    list = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3]
    ```
    
    This creates a list called `list` with 5 elements.
    

---

### **2. Slicing Lists**

- **Slicing** allows you to create sublists by specifying a start and stop index.
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```python
    mid = int(len(list) / 2)
    copiedList = list[mid:]
    list = list[:mid + 1]
    ```
    
    - `list[mid:]`: This gets all elements from the middle to the end of the list.
    - `list[:mid + 1]`: This gets all elements from the beginning up to (and including) the middle element.

---

### **3. Reversing a List**

- You can **reverse** a list using the `.reverse()` method.
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```python
    copiedList.reverse()
    ```
    
    - This will reverse the `copiedList` in place (modifying the list itself).

---

### **4. List Comparison**

- The `==` operator checks if **two lists have the same values** in the same order, not if they are the same object in memory.
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```python
    if list == copiedList:
        print("yes")
    ```
    
    - This compares `list` and `copiedList` based on their values. If they have the same values in the same order, it prints "yes".

---

### **5. Copying Lists**

- You can copy a list using:
    
    - **Slicing**: `copiedList = list[mid:]`
    - **The `.copy()` method**: `l2 = l1.copy()`
    
    The `.copy()` method creates a **shallow copy** of the list, meaning the new list contains the same values, but it is a **new object**.

---

### **6. `and` Operator in Python**

- The `and` operator is used to combine multiple conditions in a single `if` statement. Both conditions must be true for the statement to evaluate as `True`.
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```python
    l1 == l2 and print("yes it is")
    ```
    
    - This checks if `l1 == l2` is `True` and, if it is, it prints `"yes it is"`.

---

### **7. List `.count()` Method**

- The `.count()` method returns the number of occurrences of a specific element in the list.
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```python
    grade = ["c", "d", "a", "a", "b"]
    print(grade.count("a"))
    ```
    
    - This will print `2` because `"a"` appears 2 times in the list.

---

### **8. Sorting Lists**

- The `.sort()` method sorts the list in place, modifying the original list.
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```python
    grade.sort()
    print(grade)
    ```
    
    - This will sort the list alphabetically: `["a", "a", "b", "c", "d"]`.

### **Key Concepts You Learned Today**

#### **1. Lists:**

- Lists are ordered and mutable collections in Python.
- You can access list elements by index, and lists can contain mixed types.

#### **2. Slicing:**

- Slicing is used to create sublists by specifying a range of indices: `list[start:end]`.
- You can also use slicing to split lists into parts, as you did when creating `copiedList` and modifying `list`.

#### **3. Copying Lists:**

- You can copy lists using slicing (`list[:]`), `list.copy()`, or other methods, depending on your needs.
- **Shallow copy** means a new list with the same values but no references to the original list.

#### **4. Reversing a List:**

- Lists have a `.reverse()` method that reverses the list in place.

#### **5. Comparing Lists:**

- You can compare lists using `==`, which checks if their contents are the same, **not** if they are the same object in memory.

#### **6. Counting Elements:**

- The `.count()` method counts how many times a specific element appears in the list.

#### **7. Sorting Lists:**

- The `.sort()` method sorts the list in place, based on the default order (ascending for numbers or alphabetical for strings).

### **Important Concepts You Might Have Missed**

#### **Tuples:**

- You mentioned learning about **tuples**, but you didn't include them in your examples. Here’s a quick recap:
    
    - **Tuples** are like lists, but they are **immutable**, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.
    - Tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```python
    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
    ```
    
    - You cannot change a value in a tuple (e.g., `my_tuple[0] = 10` will raise an error).

#### **List Methods Recap:**

- **`.append()`**: Adds an element to the end of the list.
- **`.remove()`**: Removes the first occurrence of a specified element.
- **`.pop()`**: Removes and returns an element from the list (default is the last element).
- **`.extend()`**: Adds elements from another iterable (like another list) to the end of the list.

#### **List Comprehensions:**

- List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists in Python. You can use them to filter or modify data efficiently.
    
    **Example**:
    
    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]
    print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
    ```
