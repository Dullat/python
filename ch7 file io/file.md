### Python File I/O (Input/Output)

File I/O (Input/Output) refers to the process of reading from and writing to files. In Python, the `open()` function is used to work with files. Python provides built-in functions and methods for handling file operations such as reading, writing, appending, and closing files.

Here’s a comprehensive guide to file I/O in Python.

### 1. **Opening a File**

To interact with a file in Python, you first need to **open** it using the `open()` function.

```python
f = open("file.txt", "r")
```

#### File Modes:

- `"r"` – Read (default mode). Opens the file for reading. If the file doesn't exist, it throws an error.
- `"w"` – Write. Opens the file for writing (creates a new file if it doesn't exist, or truncates an existing file).
- `"a"` – Append. Opens the file for appending. The file is created if it doesn't exist.
- `"x"` – Exclusive creation. Creates a new file, and if the file already exists, it raises a `FileExistsError`.
- `"b"` – Binary mode. Used with other modes to read or write in binary (e.g., `"rb"` or `"wb"`).
- `"t"` – Text mode (default mode). Opens the file in text mode (e.g., `"rt"` or `"wt"`).

**Examples:**

```python
# Read mode (default)
f = open("file.txt", "r")

# Write mode
f = open("file.txt", "w")

# Append mode
f = open("file.txt", "a")

# Read binary mode
f = open("image.jpg", "rb")
```

### 2. **Reading from a File**

Once a file is opened, you can read its contents using the following methods:

#### `read()`

Reads the entire content of the file at once and returns it as a string.

```python
f = open("file.txt", "r")
content = f.read()
print(content)
f.close()
```

#### `readline()`

Reads one line at a time from the file. Useful for large files.

```python
f = open("file.txt", "r")
line = f.readline()
print(line)  # Read the first line
f.close()
```

#### `readlines()`

Reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings.

```python
f = open("file.txt", "r")
lines = f.readlines()
for line in lines:
    print(line.strip())
f.close()
```

---

### 3. **Writing to a File**

You can write to a file using the `write()` or `writelines()` methods.

#### `write()`

Writes a string to the file. If the file exists, it overwrites the content unless the file is opened in append mode.

```python
f = open("file.txt", "w")
f.write("Hello, world!")
f.close()
```

#### `writelines()`

Writes a list of strings to the file. It does not add newline characters, so you must include `\n` in each string.

```python
lines = ["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n", "Line 3\n"]
f = open("file.txt", "w")
f.writelines(lines)
f.close()
```

---

### 4. **Closing a File**

It's important to close the file when you're done with it using the `close()` method to ensure that all data is written and resources are freed.

```python
f = open("file.txt", "r")
data = f.read()
f.close()
```

Alternatively, you can use a **context manager** (`with` statement), which automatically closes the file for you when the block is done.

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    data = f.read()
    print(data)  # The file is automatically closed after this block.
```

---

### 5. **File Pointer**

The file pointer indicates where the next read or write operation will occur. You can use the following methods to manipulate the file pointer.

- `f.tell()` – Returns the current position of the file pointer.
- `f.seek(offset, whence)` – Moves the file pointer to a specific location.
    - `offset`: Number of bytes to move.
    - `whence`: Optional. It can be:
        - `0`: Absolute file positioning (default).
        - `1`: Relative to the current file position.
        - `2`: Relative to the file’s end.

Example:

```python
f = open("file.txt", "r")
print(f.tell())  # Returns the current file pointer position
f.seek(0)  # Move to the beginning of the file
print(f.tell())  # Should print 0 now
f.close()
```

---

### 6. **Working with Binary Files**

When working with binary files (e.g., images, videos), you need to use the `"b"` mode.

#### Reading a binary file:

```python
f = open("image.jpg", "rb")
content = f.read()
f.close()
```

#### Writing a binary file:

```python
f = open("image_copy.jpg", "wb")
f.write(content)
f.close()
```

---

### 7. **File Existence and Handling Errors**

Before opening a file, it's often a good practice to check if the file exists to avoid exceptions.

#### Using `os.path.exists()`:

```python
import os

if os.path.exists("file.txt"):
    with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
        data = f.read()
        print(data)
else:
    print("File does not exist.")
```

#### Using `try-except` blocks for error handling:

```python
try:
    f = open("file.txt", "r")
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File does not exist.")
finally:
    if f:
        f.close()
```

### 8. **File Operations Summary**

|Operation|Function/Method|Example Code|
|---|---|---|
|Open a file|`open()`|`f = open("file.txt", "r")`|
|Read a file|`read()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`|`data = f.read()`|
|Write to a file|`write()`, `writelines()`|`f.write("Hello World")`|
|Close a file|`close()`|`f.close()`|
|Check file exists|`os.path.exists()`|`os.path.exists("file.txt")`|
|File pointer|`tell()`, `seek()`|`f.seek(0)`|

---

### 9. **Working with Directories**

- **Create a directory**: `os.mkdir("folder_name")`
- **List files in a directory**: `os.listdir("folder_name")`
- **Change directory**: `os.chdir("folder_name")`
- **Remove a directory**: `os.rmdir("folder_name")`

### Example:

```python
import os

# Create a directory
os.mkdir("new_folder")

# List files in the current directory
print(os.listdir())

# Change current working directory
os.chdir("new_folder")

# Remove a directory
os.rmdir("old_folder")
```

---

### 10. **Temporary Files**

The `tempfile` module can be used to create temporary files that are automatically deleted when closed.

Example:

```python
import tempfile

# Create a temporary file
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=True) as tmp:
    tmp.write(b"Temporary data")
    print(tmp.name)  # Temporary file name
    print(tmp.read())
```

- **Modes**: Choose the correct file mode (`r`, `w`, `a`, etc.) for the task.
- **Error Handling**: Always handle potential errors using `try-except` blocks.
- **Binary Files**: Use the `b` mode when working with binary files.
- **Performance**: Use `with` statements to ensure files are automatically closed.
- **Directory Management**: You can manage directories using `os` and `tempfile` modules.
